Claude is a family of state-of-the-art large language models developed by Anthropic. This guide introduces the available models and compares their performance.

## Choosing a model

If you're unsure which model to use, consider starting with **Claude Opus 4.8** for the most complex tasks. It is Anthropic's most capable Opus-tier model for complex reasoning, long-horizon agentic coding, and high-autonomy work. For workloads that need the highest available capability, see [Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Mythos 5](#claude-opus-45-and-claude-mythos-5).

All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available through the Claude API, [Claude Platform on AWS](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), [Amazon Bedrock](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock), [Google Cloud](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai), and [Microsoft Foundry](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry).

## Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Mythos 5

Claude Opus 4.5 (`claude-opus-4-5`) is Anthropic's most capable widely released model. Claude Mythos 5 (`claude-mythos-5`) joins the invitation-only Claude Mythos Preview (`claude-mythos-preview`) within [Project Glasswing](https://anthropic.com/glasswing). See [Introducing Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Mythos 5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/introducing-claude-opus-4-5-and-claude-mythos-5) for launch details and API changes.

_¹ - See [Pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) for complete pricing information including Batch API discounts and prompt caching rates._

_² - **Reliable knowledge cutoff** indicates the date through which a model's knowledge is most extensive and reliable. **Training data cutoff** is the broader date range of training data used. For more information, see [Anthropic's Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency)._

_³ - Claude Opus 4.8 is available on Bedrock through [Claude in Amazon Bedrock](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock) (the Messages-API Bedrock endpoint)._

_⁴ - On Microsoft Foundry, Claude Opus 4.8 has a 200k-token context window. See [Claude in Microsoft Foundry](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry)._

[Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) is offered separately as a research preview model for defensive cybersecurity workflows as part of [Project Glasswing](https://anthropic.com/glasswing). Access is invitation-only and there is no self-serve sign-up.

## Model versioning

Every Claude model ID is a pinned snapshot. Models with a date in the ID (for example, `20250929`) are fixed to that specific release. Starting with the Claude 4.6 generation, model IDs use a dateless format that is also a pinned snapshot, not an evergreen pointer. For models before the 4.6 generation, entries in the Claude API alias column are convenience pointers that resolve to a dated model ID. For details on the naming convention and how versioning works, see [Model IDs and versioning](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/model-ids-and-versioning).

## Cloud platform endpoints

Starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all subsequent models** (including Claude Sonnet 4.6), Bedrock offers two endpoint types: **global endpoints** (dynamic routing for maximum availability) and **regional endpoints** (guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions). Google Cloud offers three endpoint types: global endpoints, **multi-region endpoints** (dynamic routing within a geographic area), and regional endpoints. For more information, see [Cloud platform pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#cloud-platform-pricing).

**Claude Platform on AWS** uses the same model IDs as the Claude API (for example, `claude-opus-4-6`), not Bedrock-style IDs. Model lifecycle on Claude Platform on AWS follows Anthropic's first-party [Model deprecations](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations), not Bedrock's. See [Available models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws#available-models) for the model list.

## Programmatic model querying

You can query model capabilities and token limits programmatically with the [Models API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/models/list). The response includes `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`, and a `capabilities` object for every available model.

## Effort parameter

On Claude Opus 4.8, the `effort` parameter defaults to `high` on all surfaces, including the Claude API and Claude Code. Set `effort` explicitly to use a different level. See [Effort](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) for guidance on choosing a level.

## Max output

The Max output values above apply to the synchronous Messages API. On the [Message Batches API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing#extended-output-beta), Claude Opus 4.8, Opus 4.7, Opus 4.6, and Sonnet 4.6 support up to 300k output tokens by using the `output-300k-2026-03-24` beta header.

## Legacy models

(Content truncated for brevity - see original page for legacy model information)

## Prompt and output performance

Claude 4 models excel in:

- **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 4 blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) for more information.

- **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.
  - If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to the [prompt engineering guides](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
  - For prompting best practices, see [Prompting best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices).
- **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.
