# Using Vision with Tools

In this recipe, we'll demonstrate how to combine Vision with tool use to analyze an image of a nutrition label and extract structured nutrition information using a custom tool.

## Setup
First, let's install the necessary libraries and set up the Claude API client:

```python

%pip install anthropic IPython

```

```python

import base64

from anthropic import Anthropic
from IPython.display import Image

client = Anthropic()
MODEL_NAME = "claude-opus-4-1"

```

# Defining the Nutrition Label Extraction Tool
Next, we'll define a custom tool called "print_nutrition_info" that extracts structured nutrition information from an image. The tool has properties for calories, total fat, cholesterol, total carbs, and protein:

```python

nutrition_tool = {
    "name": "print_nutrition_info",
    "description": "Extracts nutrition information from an image of a nutrition label",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "calories": {"type": "integer", "description": "The number of calories per serving"},
            "total_fat": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "The amount of total fat in grams per serving",
            },
            "cholesterol": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "The amount of cholesterol in milligrams per serving",
            },
            "total_carbs": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "The amount of total carbohydrates in grams per serving",
            },
            "protein": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "The amount of protein in grams per serving",
            },
        },
        "required": ["calories", "total_fat", "cholesterol", "total_carbs", "protein"],
    },
}

```

## Analyzing the Nutrition Label Image
Now, let's put it all together. We'll load a nutrition label image, pass it to Claude along with a prompt, and have Claude call the "print_nutrition_info" tool to extract the structured nutrition information into a nicely formatted JSON object:

```python

Image(filename="../images/tool_use/nutrition_label.png")

```

```python

def get_base64_encoded_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        binary_data = image_file.read()
        base_64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(binary_data)
        base64_string = base_64_encoded_data.decode("utf-8")
        return base64_string


message_list = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/png",
                    "data": get_base64_encoded_image("../images/tool_use/nutrition_label.png"),
                },
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Please print the nutrition information from this nutrition label image.",
            },
        ],
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=4096, messages=message_list, tools=[nutrition_tool]
)

if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
    last_content_block = response.content[-1]
    if last_content_block.type == "tool_use":
        tool_name = last_content_block.name
        tool_inputs = last_content_block.input
        print(f"=======Claude Wants To Call The {tool_name} Tool=======")
        print(tool_inputs)

else:
    print("No tool was called. This shouldn't happen!")

```
