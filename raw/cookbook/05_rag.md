# Retrieval Augmented Generation

Claude excels at a wide range of tasks, but it may struggle with queries specific to your unique business context. This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes invaluable. RAG enables Claude to leverage your internal knowledge bases or customer support documents, significantly enhancing its ability to answer domain-specific questions. Enterprises are increasingly building RAG applications to improve workflows in customer support, Q&A over internal company documents, financial & legal analysis, and much more.

In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to build and optimize a RAG system using the Claude Documentation as our knowledge base. We'll walk you through:

1) Setting up a basic RAG system using an in-memory vector database and embeddings from [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/).

2) Building a robust evaluation suite. We'll go beyond 'vibes' based evals and show you how to measure the retrieval pipeine & end to end performance independently.

3) Implementing advanced techniques to improve RAG including summary indexing and re-ranking with Claude.

Through a series of targeted improvements, we achieved significant performance gains on the following metrics compared to a basic RAG pipeline (we'll explain what all these metrics *mean* in a bit)

- Avg Precision: 0.43 --> 0.44
- Avg Recall: 0.66 --> 0.69
- Avg F1 Score: 0.52 --> 0.54
- Avg Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): 0.74 --> 0.87
- End-to-End Accuracy: 71% --> 81%

#### Note:

The evaluations in this cookbook are meant to mirror a production evaluation system, and you should keep in mind that they can take a while to run. Also of note: if you run the evaluations in full, you may come up against rate limits unless you are in [Tier 2 and above](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/rate-limits). Consider skipping the full end to end eval if you're trying to conserve token usage.

## Table of Contents

1) Setup

2) Level 1 - Basic RAG

3) Building an Evaluation System

4) Level 2 - Summary Indexing

5) Level 3 - Summary Indexing and Re-Ranking

## Setup

We'll need a few libraries, including:

1) `anthropic` - to interact with Claude

2) `voyageai` - to generate high quality embeddings

3) `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for data manipulation and visualization


You'll also need API keys from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) and [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/)

```python

## setup
!pip install anthropic
!pip install voyageai
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install seaborn
!pip install -U scikit-learn

```

```python

import os

os.environ["VOYAGE_API_KEY"] = "VOYAGE KEY HERE"
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "ANTHROPIC KEY HERE"

```

```python

import os

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
)

```

### Initialize a Vector DB Class

In this example, we're using an in-memory vector DB, but for a production application, you may want to use a hosted solution.

```python

import json
import os
import pickle

import numpy as np
import voyageai


class VectorDB:
    def __init__(self, name, api_key=None):
        if api_key is None:
            api_key = os.getenv("VOYAGE_API_KEY")
        self.client = voyageai.Client(api_key=api_key)
        self.name = name
        self.embeddings = []
        self.metadata = []
        self.query_cache = {}
        self.db_path = f"./data/{name}/vector_db.pkl"

    def load_data(self, data):
        if self.embeddings and self.metadata:
            print("Vector database is already loaded. Skipping data loading.")
            return
        if os.path.exists(self.db_path):
            print("Loading vector database from disk.")
            self.load_db()
            return

        texts = [f"Heading: {item['chunk_heading']}\n\n Chunk Text:{item['text']}" for item in data]
        self._embed_and_store(texts, data)
        self.save_db()
        print("Vector database loaded and saved.")

    def _embed_and_store(self, texts, data):
        batch_size = 128
        result = [
            self.client.embed(texts[i : i + batch_size], model="voyage-2").embeddings
            for i in range(0, len(texts), batch_size)
        ]
        self.embeddings = [embedding for batch in result for embedding in batch]
        self.metadata = data

    def search(self, query, k=5, similarity_threshold=0.75):
        if query in self.query_cache:
            query_embedding = self.query_cache[query]
        else:
            query_embedding = self.client.embed([query], model="voyage-2").embeddings[0]
            self.query_cache[query] = query_embedding

        if not self.embeddings:
            raise ValueError("No data loaded in the vector database.")

        similarities = np.dot(self.embeddings, query_embedding)
        top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1]
        top_examples = []

        for idx in top_indices:
            if similarities[idx] >= similarity_threshold:
                example = {
                    "metadata": self.metadata[idx],
                    "similarity": similarities[idx],
                }
                top_examples.append(example)

                if len(top_examples) >= k:
                    break
        self.save_db()
        return top_examples

    def save_db(self):
        data = {
            "embeddings": self.embeddings,
            "metadata": self.metadata,
            "query_cache": json.dumps(self.query_cache),
        }
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(self.db_path), exist_ok=True)
        with open(self.db_path, "wb") as file:
            pickle.dump(data, file)

    def load_db(self):
        if not os.path.exists(self.db_path):
            raise ValueError(
                "Vector database file not found. Use load_data to create a new database."
            )
        with open(self.db_path, "rb") as file:
            data = pickle.load(file)
        self.embeddings = data["embeddings"]
        self.metadata = data["metadata"]
        self.query_cache = json.loads(data["query_cache"])

```

## Level 1 - Basic RAG

To get started, we'll set up a basic RAG pipeline using a bare bones approach. This is sometimes called 'Naive RAG' by many in the industry. A basic RAG pipeline includes the following 3 steps:

1) Chunk documents by heading - containing only the content from each subheading

2) Embed each document

3) Use Cosine similarity to retrieve documents in order to answer query

```python

import json
import logging
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET  # noqa: S314
from collections.abc import Callable
from typing import Any

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tqdm import tqdm

# Load the evaluation dataset
with open("evaluation/docs_evaluation_dataset.json") as f:
    eval_data = json.load(f)

# Load the Claude Documentation
with open("data/anthropic_docs.json") as f:
    anthropic_docs = json.load(f)

# Initialize the VectorDB
db = VectorDB("anthropic_docs")
db.load_data(anthropic_docs)


def retrieve_base(query, db):
    results = db.search(query, k=3)
    context = ""
    for result in results:
        chunk = result["metadata"]
        context += f"\n{chunk['text']}\n"
    return results, context


def answer_query_base(query, db):
    documents, context = retrieve_base(query, db)
    prompt = f"""
    You have been tasked with helping us to answer the following query:
    <query>
    {query}
    </query>
    You have access to the following documents which are meant to provide context as you answer the query:
    <documents>
    {context}
    </documents>
    Please remain faithful to the underlying context, and only deviate from it if you are 100% sure that you know the answer already.
    Answer the question now, and avoid providing preamble such as 'Here is the answer', etc
    """
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-haiku-4-5",
        max_tokens=2500,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0,
    )
    return response.content[0].text

```

## Eval Setup

When evaluating RAG applications, it's critical to evaluate the performance of the retrieval system and end to end system separately.

We synthetically generated an evaluation dataset consisting of 100 samples which include the following:
- A question
- Chunks from our docs which are relevant to that question. This is what we expect our retrieval system to retrieve when the question is asked
- A correct answer to the question.

This is a relatively challenging dataset. Some of our questions require synthesis between more than one chunk in order to be answered correctly, so it's important that our system can load in more than one chunk at a time. You can inspect the dataset by opening `evaluation/docs_evaluation_dataset.json`

Run the next cell to see a preview of the dataset

```python

# previewing our eval dataset
import json


def preview_json(file_path, num_items=3):
    try:
        with open(file_path) as file:
            data = json.load(file)

        if isinstance(data, list):
            preview_data = data[:num_items]
        elif isinstance(data, dict):
            preview_data = dict(list(data.items())[:num_items])
        else:
            print(f"Unexpected data type: {type(data)}. Cannot preview.")
            return

        print(f"Preview of the first {num_items} items from {file_path}:")
        print(json.dumps(preview_data, indent=2))
        print(f"\nTotal number of items: {len(data)}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f"Invalid JSON in file: {file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")


preview_json("evaluation/docs_evaluation_dataset.json")

```

# Metric Definitions
We'll evaluate our system based on 5 key metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and End-to-End Accuracy.

## Retrieval Metrics:

### Precision
Precision represents the proportion of retrieved chunks that are actually relevant. It answers the question: "Of the chunks we retrieved, how many were correct?"

Key points:
- High precision indicates an efficient system with few false positives.
- Low precision suggests many irrelevant chunks are being retrieved.
- Our system retrieves a minimum of 3 chunks per query, which may affect precision scores.

Formula:
$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{Total Retrieved}} = \frac{|\text{Retrieved} \cap \text{Correct}|}{|\text{Retrieved}|}
$$

### Recall
Recall measures the completeness of our retrieval system. It answers the question: "Of all the correct chunks that exist, how many did we manage to retrieve?"

Key points:
- High recall indicates comprehensive coverage of necessary information.
- Low recall suggests important chunks are being missed.
- Recall is crucial for ensuring the LLM has access to all needed information.

Formula:
$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{Total Correct}} = \frac{|\text{Retrieved} \cap \text{Correct}|}{|\text{Correct}|}
$$

### F1 Score
The F1 score provides a balanced measure between precision and recall. It's particularly useful when you need a single metric to evaluate system performance, especially with uneven class distributions.

Key points:
- F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect precision and recall.
- It's the harmonic mean of precision and recall, tending towards the lower of the two values.
- Useful in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives are important.

Formula:
$$
\text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$

Interpreting F1 score:
- An F1 score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.
- An F1 score of 0.0 indicates the worst performance.
- Generally, the higher the F1 score, the better the overall performance.

### Balancing Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:
- There's often a trade-off between precision and recall.
- Our system's minimum chunk retrieval favors recall over precision.
- The optimal balance depends on the specific use case.
- In many RAG systems, high recall is often prioritized, as LLMs can filter out less relevant information during generation.

### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) @k
MRR measures how well our system ranks relevant information. It helps us understand how quickly a user would find what they're looking for if they started from the top of our retrieved results.

Key points:
- MRR ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect (correct answer always first).
- It only considers the rank of the first correct result for each query.
- Higher MRR indicates better ranking of relevant information.

Formula:
$$
\text{MRR} = \frac{1}{|Q|} \sum_{i=1}^{|Q|} \frac{1}{\text{rank}_i}
$$

Where:
- |Q| is the total number of queries
- rank_i is the position of the first relevant item for the i-th query

## End to End Metrics:

### End to End Accuracy
We use an LLM-as-judge (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to evaluate whether the generated answer is correct based on the question and ground truth answer.

Formula:
$$
\text{End to End Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Answers}}{\text{Total Number of Questions}}
$$

This metric evaluates the entire pipeline, from retrieval to answer generation.

## Defining Our Metric Calculation Functions

            ]

        Small differences or changes in wording don't matter. If the generated answer and correct answer are saying essentially the same thing then that generated answer should be marked correct.

        However, if there is any critical piece of information which is missing from the generated answer in comparison to the correct answer, then we should mark this as incorrect.

# Level 2: Document Summarization for Enhanced Retrieval

In this section, we'll implement an improved approach to our retrieval system by incorporating document summaries. Instead of embedding chunks directly from the documents, we'll create a concise summary for each chunk and use this summary along with the original content in our embedding process.

This approach aims to capture the essence of each document chunk more effectively, potentially leading to improved retrieval performance.

Key steps in this process:
1. We load the original document chunks.
2. For each chunk, we generate a 2-3 sentence summary using Claude.
3. We store both the original content and the summary for each chunk in a new json file: `data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json`

This summary-enhanced approach is designed to provide more context during the embedding and retrieval phases, potentially improving the system's ability to understand and match the most relevant documents to user queries.

## Generating the Summaries and Storing Them

```python

import json

from tqdm import tqdm


def generate_summaries(input_file, output_file):
    # Load the original documents
    with open(input_file) as f:
        docs = json.load(f)

    # Prepare the context about the overall knowledge base
    knowledge_base_context = "This is documentation for Anthropic's, a frontier AI lab building Claude, an LLM that excels at a variety of general purpose tasks. These docs contain model details and documentation on Anthropic's APIs."

    summarized_docs = []

    for doc in tqdm(docs, desc="Generating summaries"):
        prompt = f"""
        You are tasked with creating a short summary of the following content from Anthropic's documentation.

        Context about the knowledge base:
        {knowledge_base_context}

        Content to summarize:
        Heading: {doc["chunk_heading"]}
        {doc["text"]}

        Please provide a brief summary of the above content in 2-3 sentences. The summary should capture the key points and be concise. We will be using it as a key part of our search pipeline when answering user queries about this content.

        Avoid using any preamble whatsoever in your response. Statements such as 'here is the summary' or 'the summary is as follows' are prohibited. You should get straight into the summary itself and be concise. Every word matters.
        """

        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-haiku-4-5",
            max_tokens=150,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0,
        )

        summary = response.content[0].text.strip()

        summarized_doc = {
            "chunk_link": doc["chunk_link"],
            "chunk_heading": doc["chunk_heading"],
            "text": doc["text"],
            "summary": summary,
        }
        summarized_docs.append(summarized_doc)

    # Save the summarized documents to a new JSON file
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump(summarized_docs, f, indent=2)

    print(f"Summaries generated and saved to {output_file}")


# generate_summaries('data/anthropic_docs.json', 'data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json')

```

# Summary-Indexed Vector Database Creation

Here, we're creating a new vector database that incorporates our summary-enhanced document chunks. This approach combines the original text, the chunk heading, and the newly generated summary into a single text for embedding.

Key features of this process:
1. We create embeddings for the combined text (heading + summary + original content) using the Voyage AI API.
2. The embeddings and full metadata (including summaries) are stored in our vector database.
3. We implement caching mechanisms to improve efficiency in repeated queries.
4. The database is saved to disk for persistence and quick loading in future sessions.

This summary-indexed approach aims to create more informative embeddings, potentially leading to more accurate and contextually relevant document retrieval.

# Enhanced Retrieval Using Summary-Indexed Embeddings

In this section, we implement the retrieval process using our new summary-indexed vector database. This approach leverages the enhanced embeddings we created, which incorporate document summaries along with the original content.

Key aspects of this updated retrieval process:
1. We search the vector database using the query embedding, retrieving the top k most similar documents.
2. For each retrieved document, we include the chunk heading, summary, and full text in the context provided to the LLM.
3. This enriched context is then used to generate an answer to the user's query.

By including summaries in both the embedding and retrieval phases, we aim to provide the LLM with a more comprehensive and focused context. This could potentially lead to more accurate and relevant answers, as the LLM has access to both a concise overview (the summary) and the detailed information (the full text) for each relevant document chunk.

```python

def retrieve_level_two(query, db):
    results = db.search(query, k=3)
    context = ""
    for result in results:
        chunk = result["metadata"]
        context += f"\n <document> \n {chunk['chunk_heading']}\n\nText\n {chunk['text']} \n\nSummary: \n {chunk['summary']} \n </document> \n"  # show model all 3 items

## Level 3 - Re-Ranking with Claude
In this final enhancement to our retrieval system, we introduce a reranking step to further improve the relevance of the retrieved documents. This approach leverages Claude's power to better understand the context and nuances of both the query and the retrieved documents.

The `rerank_results` function uses Claude to reassess and reorder the initially retrieved documents:
1. It presents Claude with the query and summaries of all retrieved documents.
2. Claude is asked to select and rank the most relevant documents.
3. The function parses Claude's response to get the reranked document indices.
4. It includes fallback mechanisms in case of errors or insufficient results.
5. Finally, it assigns descending relevance scores to the reranked results.

The `retrieve_advanced` function implements the new retrieval pipeline:
1. We initially retrieve more documents than needed (default 20, configurable via `initial_k`) from the vector database.
2. We then use the `rerank_results` function to refine this larger set down to the most relevant documents (default 3, configurable via `k`).
3. Finally, it generates a new context string from these reranked documents.

This process casts a wider net initially and then uses AI to focus on the most pertinent information. By combining vector-based retrieval with LLM reranking, this approach aims to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate responses to user queries.

Our evaluations show significant improvements:
- Accuracy increased from 78% in our previous system to 85%.
- Precision was improved by using our re-ranker to reduce the number of documents shown to the LLM.
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) was likely improved by asking Claude to rank the relevance of each document in order.

These improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating AI-powered reranking in our retrieval process.

def rerank_results(query: str, results: list[dict], k: int = 5) -> list[dict]:
    # Prepare the summaries with their indices

## Evaluation - Going Deeper with Promptfoo

This guide has illustrated the importance of measuring prompt performance empirically when prompt engineering. You can read more about our empirical methodology to prompt engineering here. Using a Jupyter Notebook is a great way to start prompt engineering but as your datasets grow larger and your prompts more numerous it is important to leverage tooling that will scale with you.

In this section of the guide we will explore using Promptfoo an open source LLM evaluation toolkit. To get started head over to the ./evaluation directory and checkout the ./evaluation/README.md.

Promptfoo makes it very easy to build automated test suites that compare different models, hyperparameter choices, and prompts against one another. 

As an example, you can run the below cell to see the average performance of Haiku vs 3.5 Sonnet across all of our test cases.

```python

import json
