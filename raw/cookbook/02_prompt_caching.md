# Prompt caching with the Claude API

Prompt caching lets you store and reuse context within your prompts, reducing latency by >2x and costs by up to 90% for repetitive tasks.

There are two ways to enable prompt caching:

- **Automatic caching** (recommended): Add a single `cache_control` field at the top level of your request. The system automatically manages cache breakpoints for you.
- **Explicit cache breakpoints**: Place `cache_control` on individual content blocks for fine-grained control over exactly what gets cached.

This cookbook demonstrates both approaches, starting with the simpler automatic method.

## Setup





Let's fetch the full text of *Pride and Prejudice* (~187k tokens) to use as our large context.



We'll also define a small helper to print usage stats:

## Example 1: Automatic caching (single turn)

Automatic caching is the easiest way to get started. Add `cache_control={"type": "ephemeral"}` at the **top level** of your `messages.create()` call and the system handles the rest — automatically placing the cache breakpoint on the last cacheable block.

We'll compare three scenarios:
1. **No caching** — baseline
2. **First cached call** — creates the cache entry (similar timing to baseline)
3. **Second cached call** — reads from cache (the big speedup)

### Baseline: no caching



### First call with automatic caching (cache write)

The only change is the top-level `cache_control` parameter. The first call writes to the cache, so timing is similar to the baseline.



### Second call with automatic caching (cache hit)

Same request again. This time the cached prefix is reused, so you should see a significant speedup.



---
## Example 2: Automatic caching in a multi-turn conversation

Automatic caching really shines in multi-turn conversations. The cache breakpoint **automatically moves forward** as the conversation grows — you don't need to manage any markers yourself.

| Request | Cache behavior |
|---------|----------------|
| Request 1 | System + User:A cached (write) |
| Request 2 | System + User:A read from cache; Asst:B + User:C written to cache |
| Request 3 | System through User:C read from cache; Asst:D + User:E written to cache |



After the first turn, nearly 100% of input tokens are read from cache on every subsequent turn. The conversation code is just a plain list of messages — no special `cache_control` markers needed on individual blocks.

---
## Example 3: Explicit cache breakpoints

For more control, you can place `cache_control` directly on individual content blocks. This is useful when:

- You want to cache different sections with different TTLs
- You need to cache a system prompt independently from message content
- You want fine-grained control over what gets cached

You can also combine both approaches: use explicit breakpoints for your system prompt while automatic caching handles the conversation.

Below, we place `cache_control` directly on the book content block and manually move the breakpoint forward on each turn.



---
## Choosing an approach

| | Automatic caching | Explicit breakpoints |
|---|---|---|
| **Ease of use** | One-line change | Must place and move `cache_control` markers |
| **Multi-turn** | Breakpoint moves forward automatically | You manage breakpoint placement |
| **Fine-grained control** | No | Up to 4 independent breakpoints |
| **Mixed TTLs** | Single TTL for auto breakpoint | Different TTLs per breakpoint |
| **Combinable** | Yes — automatic + explicit together | Yes |

**Start with automatic caching.** It covers the majority of use cases with minimal effort. Switch to explicit breakpoints only when you need fine-grained control.

### Key details

- **Minimum cacheable length:** 1,024 tokens for Sonnet; 4,096 tokens for Opus and Haiku 4.5
- **Cache TTL:** 5 minutes by default (refreshed on each hit). A 1-hour TTL is available at 2x base input price.
- **Pricing:** Cache writes cost 1.25x base input price. Cache reads cost 0.1x base input price.
- **Breakpoint limit:** Up to 4 explicit breakpoints per request. Automatic caching uses one slot.
